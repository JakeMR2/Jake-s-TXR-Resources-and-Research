# Jake-s-TXR-Resources-and-Research
Resources from current Cheat Engine tables, research, pnachs, etc


## Pnaches
These pnaches are from me and several others. I put them all here for ease of use. Also to easily to keep these up to date.

## Resource files
These range from Cheat Engine tables to .txt stuff about the .DAT/.TOC format, these are seperated by game.

[IMPORTANT]
If you can. Anyone can contribute to the research and make things further for actual research to be done about the series. It's still being done but at a slow rate.
